# Horror-Movie-Ratings
This is a little project I made after wondering if Horror Movies are rated higher during Halloween season compared to other times of the year. I was motivated to work on this project since I thought that if people were nicer during Christmas season, would they be more prone to scares during Halloween season? And, would that contribute to a higher rating on Horror Movies?
